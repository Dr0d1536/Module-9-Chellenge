# Module 9 SQL

## MOD_9_Queries.sql
* I created 6 tables by importing 6 CSV files: department, dept_emp, dept_manager, employees, salaries and titles. 
* Primary keys: department: Dept_no, employees: emp_no, *titles: title_id*
* Forign keys: dept_emp: emp_no and dept_no, dept_manager: dept_no and emp_no, salaries: emp_no

***** THE TITLE CSV FILE WAS INCLUDED IN THE MODULE BUT WAS NOT USED.******
***** THERE IS ALSO NO NEED TO USE THE NOT NULL CONDITION SINCE ALL THE DATA WAS PRESENT****
